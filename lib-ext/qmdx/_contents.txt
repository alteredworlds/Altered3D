QMDX 4.13 SDK (Build 34)
EMail / Download Distribution Version 07/98
===========================================

In your possession is a powerful interactive audio tool and a
lot of useful information. The following text briefly describes
the resources in this SDK. Spending a few minutes to read through
this will save you from missing good stuff!


QMDX: Powerful, FREE Interactive Audio
======================================

In this SDK you'll find everything you need to ease the
development of advanced interactive digital audio applications
for Microsoft(R) Windows(R), DirectSound(R) and DirectSound3D(R).

We've solved the most bothersome challenges of DS/DS3D programming
so that you can put more effort into content, and less into 
nitty gritty coding and debugging.

Hardware support is dramatically simplified for both accelerated
and non-accelerated systems, yet you can retain as much control 
as you desire.


No Spring Chicken
-----------------

Even though QMDX is new, it is derived directly from an SDK which has
years of development, refinement and application to its credit.

That's why QMDX carries a version number of 4.11. This is fourth 
generation interactive Windows audio technology with roots
all the way back before DirectSound and Windows 95 had seen the 
light of day.


IMPORTANT NOTE
==============

You'll see plenty of reminders here and there, and you had to
accept the conditions of our license agreement to install and use
this software, but we'll state up front so it's clear:

QMDX is free for you to use in any application apart from the
creation of authoring tools. You are under no pressure or obligation
to purchase any QSound product -- the whole idea of QMDX is to give
you a tool that eases advanced audio development. You can go out 
there and crank some killer titles. You need have no worries about 
crawling up a learning curve only to find that the boss won't 
foot the license fee -- THERE ISN'T ONE!

However, you are effectively getting two SDK's in one. One of
them is for evaluation only, and is, unlike QMDX, NOT free.

QMixer Evaluation Included
-------==========---------

The SDK includes everything you need to evaluate QMDX's daddy,
QMixer. Both QMDX and QMixer support DS3D hardware cards -- quite 
elegantly, in fact. Both include their own, highly optimised mix
engines to extend hardware capabilities and to render your audio
on non-accelerated systems without additional coding.

The QMDX mix engine is stereo, while QMixer has a full 3D software
engine that puts some hardware cards to shame. We're sorry to say 
we can't give that one away. It's here for you to evaluate.

We want to emphasize that this is explicitly provided for your 
convenience. In the past, to evaluate QMixer, you would have had to
sign up for a 60 day trial period, blah blah... that's no longer
necessary.

Frankly, the two products are so closely related that they share 
the same API. If we so much as included a demo of QMixer with the
SDK, (and why wouldn't we?) or you picked up a game that has been 
written with QMixer, between the two you would have effectively had 
everything you needed to check it out anyway. We thought we'd save
you the trouble of figuring this out for yourself and just make the
whole thing legit. No sweaty palms!


Contents of this SDK:

Root:
=====

_contents.txt	This file

_readme.txt	This file always contains a revision history. It is 
		highly recommended that you read it carefully, especially
		when downloading a new SDK.

licence.txt
licence.pdf	Your licence for this SDK in text and Adobe Acrobat formats.

QM413API.doc
QM413API.pdf	The QM SDK reference bible: your guide to the API in Word97
		and Adobe PDF formats.

qmdx.reg	Double-click on this to load useful defaults for the
		QMShow demos into your registry. Since all demos (including
		those you may create yourself from the source code) refer
		to the registry for settings, be aware that loading these
		into the registry will alter any settings saved there from
		previous versions.

EndUser
=======		This directory contains an end-user license agreement that
		may be used with little modification or integrated into your
		standard end-user agreement for distribution of QMDX titles.
		Note that this is a requirement of _your_ license to use QMDX.

Examples
========	A collection of simple console-mode programs illustrating basic
		useful QM concepts.

Qmdx
====		Herein lie the goodies you need to compile a QMDX application,
		as well as a version of the QMShow demo / experimentation
		program compiled for QMDX.

QMixer
======		Likewise for QMixer. Your 27th reminder: QMixer is not free,
		and is supplied as part of this SDK for evaluation only.

QMShow
======		Source and resources for the QMShow demo application.

Waves
=====		A minimal set of sounds to get you started playing with QMShow.
		If you double-click on qmdx.reg (root SDK directory) one of the
		settings saved is a relative path to these wave files for each
		QMShow channel, so you can fire it up right away.

Notes on QMShow
===============
   
   QMShow (alias QMixShow, QMDXShow depending on the flavor) is a multi-
   purpose test application with a cheasy graphical interface for you to 
   laugh at. (We call the listener sprite "fathead.") 

   Don't write QMShow off! It's a great platform for experimenting with
   the supplied sound files -- or your own -- and the myriad features 
   that QM provides. You can quickly configure buffer support options
   and priority schemes, toggle various scaleability features (like pitch
   shift interpolation) to assess the trade-offs, set distance mapping 
   parameters etc. etc... move sounds around the listener or move the
   listener around the sounds. A "Run paths" feature captures your mouse
   movements so that you can loop short "scenes" with multiple sounds in
   motion.

   One precaution. Note that fathead really has a fat head! At the scale
   shown, the head is actually about a meter across! Needless to say, it's
   there as a rough reference only.

   The Waves directory contains an assortment of short 22kHz sounds. Most
   are mono, but one stereo file has been included to demonstrate how QM
   handles stereo files, and hopefully to get you thinking about how useful
   they can be. Refer to \waves\_readme.txt for further details.
