WARNING!
========

The QMShow demos have myriad options. Both versions store
information about currently selected options in the registry.

Therefore if you run one version and make changes, if you run
a different version at a later time, those same changes will 
apply!

---------

Remember that QMDX is identical to QMixer except it has a stereo,
rather than 3D engine. Because the API is shared, any configuration
calls to the QMixer 3D engine (like QSound vs stereo mode, enhanced
rear processing, etc.) are simply ignored by QMDX.
