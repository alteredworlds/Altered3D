<p>Included in this package, you should find a zip file containing two sample 
  scenes: <b>AlteredSaver3MAX.zip</b>. This will be installed by default in: 'c:\Program 
  Files\AlteredWorlds\AlteredSaver'. Extract the contents to a new folder, and 
  open the scene '<b>PlayHouse.max</b>'.</p>
<h4>From MAX's 'Select File To Export' dialog, select file type: 'AlteredWorlds 
  Export (*.TNT)'</h4>
<p align="left">You should see the dialog below - please make sure all selected 
  options match those shown here. Hit 'Ok' and wait a while...</p>

<p>Once the Export is finished, you should see a dialog similar to the one below:</p>
<p><img src="images/finished.jpg" width="551" height="438"></p>
<p>If everything is setup correctly on your machine, you can hit 'Yes' at this 
  time to view the scene right away. You can also use the AlteredSaver configuration 
  dialog to select this scene and view it in the saver.</p>
<p>Once you've successfully completed one export, you're ready to go - modify 
  our sample scenes to get the feel of how this thing works - then build your 
  own content from scratch. We're excited to see what you come up with!</p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your First AlteredSaver 
  Scene - things to remember:</font></h4>
<p>You need to have a camera in your scene. AlteredWorlds' engine requires that 
  all MAX cameras have the option 'Clip Manually' checked, with suitable values 
  in the 'Near Clip' and 'Far Clip' fields. Uncheck 'Include Lights' on the export 
  dialog - seeing your scene with default OpenGL lighting can sometimes make things 
  easier...! </p>
