<p align="left">An 'AlteredWorld' (or AlteredSaver 'scene') currently consists 
  of a file with extension '.tnt'. This file contains all data required to render 
  the scene, including textures.</p>
<p align="left">TNT scenes may be viewed using any version of AlteredWorlds' engine 
  with version number *greater than* or *the same as* this exporter [v3.0 beta]. 
  This means you can<b> view exported content only</b> on the<b> beta saver version 
  included in this package</b>, but not on any earlier versions of our software. 
  <b>When the full version 3 of AlteredSaver is released, content exported with 
  this beta version will work just fine</b> (and will be viewable on all future 
  versions, as well).</p>
<p align="left">This beta version of our exporter is the <b>first to be released 
  to the public</b>. We've had some very encouraging responses from 3D Studio 
  MAX Artists who've checked it out. All of AlteredWolrds' award winning content 
  was created using previous versions of this exporter - we'd love to see what 
  other people can come up with!</p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BUG REPORTS 
  - this is a BETA version, guys...:</font></b></p>
<p align="left">We're very interested in hearing about any problems you encounter 
  with AlteredExporter. We'll try and fix any bugs as quickly as possible - no 
  promises, though! To make this possible, please try and include the following 
  with any bug report:</p>
<p align="left">(i) Description of how to repeat the problem.<b> (ii) A SAMPLE 
  MAX FILE </b>(the simplest possible example of the problem, please)<b>!</b></p>
<p align="left">We'd appreciate a positive approach - try and see what cool stuff 
  you CAN produce with this tool - and we'll work together to solve any problems... 
</p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Known Issues:</font></b><br>
  Bump Mapping is not working perfectly at the moment - you can get some fun effects 
  with a little experimentation, but specular effects are currently missing. As 
  soon as we get some time, this'll be fixed...</p>
