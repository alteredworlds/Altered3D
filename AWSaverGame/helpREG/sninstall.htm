<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#80000000"><a name="basicInstall"></a>Basic 
  Install Procedure - Registered Version</font></b></p>
<p>Run '<b>AlteredSaver3.exe</b>'. You'll be guided through the installation process, 
  which should be pretty straightforward. </p>
<p>Please make sure you are connected to the internet during the installation 
  process, as AlteredSaver needs to get an unlock code from AlteredWorlds.com. 
  If this presents a problem, please contact us at support@alteredworlds.com for 
  a manual unlock code - see below.</p>
<p>You'll first have to <b>agree to our license agreement</b>.</p>
<p>Next, you must enter your <b>name</b>, <b>address</b> and <b>serial number. 
  </b>The serial number is given in the <b>purchase confirmation email</b> you 
  received when you bought AlteredSaver v3.</p>
<p>This information (and nothing else) is sent to AlteredWorlds and <b>we automatically 
  send back your personal AlteredSaver activation code</b>. If you have difficulties 
  with the auto install, please contact support@alteredworlds.com. Send us the 
  <b>EXACT</b> name, email address and serial number and we'll send you back an 
  unlock code to enter manually. It is usually best to 'cut &amp; paste' this 
  information as capital letters and spaces DO make a difference...!</p>
<p>Pick your <b>destination folder</b> - the value already selected should be 
  just fine.</p>
<p><b>Select your setup type:<br>
  </b></p>
<table width="544" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td width="540"><font color="#80000000"><b>'AlteredSaver v3 - Screen Saver'</b></font> 
      is already selected and will be fine for most people.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="540"><font color="#80000000"><b>'AlteredSaver v3 - Screen Saver 
      and MAX Exporter' </b></font> if you would like to try our 3D Studio 
      MAX Exporter plugin, please pick this second option. You'll be asked 
      to specify your 3D Studio MAX Plugin folder, so you'll need to know 
      where 3D Studio MAX is installed! All '3rd Party' plugins like ours 
      are put in a folder named 'plugins' underneath the main 3D Studio MAX 
      install directory; the install program needs to know exactly where this 
      is.</td>

    <td width="93%">From the Windows <b>'Display Properties' Dialog</b>, go to

<p>We tried to make AlteredSaver v3 the highest quality software AlteredWorlds 
  have yet released - and our earlier versions won 5 Star Awards from ZDNet and 
  other awards. However, it's possible that some bugs may have crept in along 
  the way... </p>
<p><b>Video Card Issues:</b><br>
  If you experience problems such as slow performance, application crashes and 
  similar, please check the version of your <b>display drivers</b>. We are confident 
  our use of OpenGL is correct: we always advise users to make sure they are using 
  the most recent drivers offered by the manufacturer of their video card. However 
  - updating video drivers can sometimes present difficulties. Before attempting 
  any such sytem change, you should make sure to back up any important data, just 
  in case. [AlteredWorlds can't be held responsible for any issues resulting from 
  changing video drivers].</p>
<p>The bottom line: if there's any doubt, please <b>use our free shareware release 
  to test AlteredSaver on your system before buying it!</b></p>
<p><b>Tested Video Hardware:</b><br>
  Any graphics card based on an NVIDIA chip (RIVA128, TNT, TNT2, GeForce and better) 
  <br>
  Matrox G200, G400 and newer<br>
  Kyro II (using a PowerVR chip)</p>
<p>ATI chips from the Rage Pro and newer are perfectly capable of running our 
  software - depending on the OpenGl driver support. Under Linux these cards work 
  well, but on Windows ATI's drivers can be suspect at times. Same goes for cards 
  from 3Dfx. Please report your results to us!</p>
