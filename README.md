# Altered3D
AlteredWorlds 3D stuff from ages ago. 32bit C++ OpenGL, Win32, iOS.

AlteredWorlds produced award-winning interactive real-time 3D screensavers & games. 

Approached by Autodesk & NVIDIA with a view to producing joint products; funding issues prevented these projects from going ahead.

Our interactive screensavers & games won multiple awards & attracted more than 300,000 users, featuring in top 5% of ZDNet downloads for many months. 

This repo contains all the code for our cross-platform 3D graphics engine (OpenGL, C++), 3D Studio MAX plugin exporting to own binary file format, including image assets.
